## 5. ROI Calculation Example  

**Investment:** €100,000 in AI tools, paid ads, and automation over 6 months  
**Baseline Conversion:** 18% → **Post-Optimization:** 40% (122% increase)  
**Lead Volume:** 1,000 leads/month → 6,000 leads total  
**Conversions Baseline:** 1,080 customers (18%)  
**Conversions Post:** 2,400 customers (40%)  
**Incremental Customers:** 1,320  
**Average Deal Size:** €1,800  
**Incremental Revenue:** 1,320 × €1,800 = €2,376,000  
**CAC Increase:** Slightly higher due to ads, but offset by volume and efficiency  
**ROI:** (€2,376,000 - €100,000 investment) / €100,000 = 22.76x
