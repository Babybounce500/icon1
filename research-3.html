# 5. Technology Considerations  

- **OpenAI API & GDPR:**  
  - Ensure data minimization, user consent, and transparency in AI advisory outputs.  
  - Implement on-premise or EU-region cloud hosting (AWS EU, Azure EU) to comply with DORA & NIS2.  

- **Multilingual Support:**  
  - Whisper API for speech-to-text in FR/ES/IT/NL/PL.  
  - Text-to-Speech (TTS) engines tuned for local accents and languages.  

- **Cybersecurity:**  
  - Align with EU cybersecurity frameworks, regular audits, and incident response plans.  

---

# 6. Practical Recommendations  

- Prioritize Spain and Netherlands for initial launch to balance market opportunity and regulatory complexity.  
- Develop strong local partnerships early to facilitate licensing and market penetration.  
- Invest in cultural adaptation, especially in Italy and France, to build trust in AI advisory.  
- Monitor evolving EU AI Act and local regulations closely to avoid compliance risks.  
- Leverage OpenAI API capabilities while ensuring data privacy and security.
